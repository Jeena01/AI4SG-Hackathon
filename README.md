### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Immigrant and refugee women in Canada face heightened risks of domestic violence due to isolation, cultural barriers, and financial struggles. Current support systems often lack cultural competence, leaving these cases underreported and inadequately addressed. 

Having social workers from the same cultural backgrounds as immigrant and refugee women can significantly enhance the effectiveness of support services. These social workers bring not only linguistic fluency but also an understanding of cultural norms, values, and specific challenges faced by their clients. This cultural competence fosters trust and openness, encouraging women to disclose experiences of domestic violence and seek help. Furthermore, culturally aware social workers can tailor interventions that resonate with clientsâ€™ lived experiences, promoting a more holistic approach to healing and empowerment. By bridging the gap between the clients and the support systems, these social workers can help create a safer and more accessible environment for those in need.
In healthcare, for example, providers who share cultural backgrounds with patients can enhance communication, increase adherence to treatment plans, and reduce disparities in health outcomes. In education, teachers from diverse backgrounds can better connect with students, fostering an inclusive environment that acknowledges and values cultural differences, ultimately improving academic performance and engagement.

In the legal field, attorneys with cultural understanding can navigate complex cases involving clients from immigrant or marginalized communities more effectively, ensuring that their rights are protected and their voices heard. Similarly, in the corporate sector, diverse teams that reflect the cultural backgrounds of their customer base can drive innovation, enhance customer satisfaction, and strengthen community relations. By prioritizing cultural competence, industries can create more equitable, effective, and responsive systems that truly meet the needs of their diverse clientele.


### PROPOSED SOLUTION
We propose a free software solution designed to connect clients with professionals who possess relevant cultural expertise, providing effective support for vulnerable and marginalized communities. Our back-end system is tailored for administrative use, matching clients with providers based on input data such as gender, age, ethnicity, and culture. This system is customizable to meet the specific needs of various organizations, making it applicable for therapy clinics and social services offices.

The Cultural Care Compass utilizes a hybrid recommendation system, which combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. This established algorithm ensures effective pairing of clients with practitioners who share similar backgrounds and experiences, fostering a sense of safety, mutual understanding, and enhancing communication and trust in client-provider interactions.

We prioritize client privacy by implementing algorithms that do not require third-party access to any organizational data. Future developments will focus on creating a front-end system that allows organizations to customize client and provider data fields, improving search functionality and incorporating more detailed input variables through natural language processing.

By bridging the gap between clients and culturally competent professionals, our solution aims to create a more inclusive and effective support system that truly addresses the needs of diverse communities.
