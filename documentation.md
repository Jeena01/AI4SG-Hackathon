## 2. Documentation of AI Tools Used

### 2.1 Overview of AI Tools
- **Tool Name**: ChatGPT, Amazon Q.
- **Purpose**: ChatGPT wa used to answer questions that seemed to specific for the internet to provide solutions for. 

### 2.2 Application of AI Tools
- **When Applied**: ChatGPT was ued throughout the entire development of our project, from brainstorming, developing, and creating the presntation. Amazon Q was used primarily during code writing.
- **How Applied**: When we encountered a creative block, needed to find errors in our code, or wanted to reword any sentences 
- **Rationale**: ChatGPT was used for its user-friendly set up and timely responses. It was eay and efficient and can be used for specific situations. Amazon Q was used becaue it provides in-line suggestsions.

### 2.3 Total use of AI Tools
- **Amrita-- %75**: Used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas by providing the prompt. Asked ChatGPT to explain how to download and install applications such as Node.js and React. Asked ChatGPT to rephrase sentences I made for the presentation for the language to sound more fluent and cohesive. Gave ChatGPT any error outputs I would get while coding with React and asked it why I might be receiving these messages (did not end up using my react work on final outcome). 
- **Yosamin %70**:Used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas by providing the prompt and providing personal expierences I had as a minority group in Canada in hopes to help ChatGPT think of some solutions. Asked ChatGPT to write some starter code for me to build off of. 
- **Jeena %90**: Used ChatGPT for boiler plate code and used amazon Q for generating dummy data and inline changes and documentation.
